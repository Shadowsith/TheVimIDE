 CSS Beautifier
---------------

    Written by Harutyun Amirjanyan, (amirjanyan@gmail.com)

    Based on code initially developed by: Einar Lielmanis, <einar@jsbeautifier.org>
        http://jsbeautifier.org/

    Usage:
        css_beautify(source_text);
        css_beautify(source_text, options);

    The options are (default in brackets):
        indent_size (4)                         — indentation size,
        indent_char (space)                     — character to indent with,
        selector_separator_newline (true)       - separate selectors with newline or
                                                  not (e.g. "a,\nbr" or "a, br")
        end_with_newline (false)                - end with a newline
        newline_between_rules (true)            - add a new line after every css rule
        space_around_selector_separator (false) - ensure space around selector separators:
                                                  '>', '+', '~' (e.g. "a>b" -> "a > b")
    e.g

    css_beautify(css_source_text, {
      'indent_size': 1,
      'indent_char': '\t',
      'selector_separator': ' ',
      'end_with_newline': false,
      'newline_between_rules': true,
      'space_around_selector_separator': true
    });
