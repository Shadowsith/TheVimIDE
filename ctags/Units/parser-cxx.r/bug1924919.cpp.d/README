The orignal bug report can be found in https://sourceforge.net/p/ctags/bugs/217/

I, Masatake YAMATO, think both a bug report and developer of e-ctags go wrong.

Let's consider following input:

    #include <string>
    namespace mud {
	    std::string MajorVersion;
	    std::string MinorVersion;
	    int (* foo) (void);
    };
    

All MajorVersion, MinorVersion and foo are tagged with 'm' kind.
This is less informative. Whether they are members or not can
be known from "namespace:mud" field of tags file.
