Please, add your name, background and interests here If you are
interested in contributing to universal-ctags steadily. So we can
dispatch a task and/or an issue to the right person!

(Keep the list in alphabetical order.)


Frank Fesevur <ffes@users.sourceforge.net>

	My current use of ctags is for a Notepad++ plug-in I'm writing.
	The plug-in is not yet released because of problems with the
	Windows version of ctags. Those problems are fixed by now.
	I am a Windows developer, but also an occasional Ubuntu and
	Raspbian user at home. I wrote the windres parser.

Colomban Wendling <colomban@geany.org>

	I am a developer of Geany, a lightweight IDE/editor that uses CTags
	parsers to provide various code insights for a large variety of
	languages. I don't use CTags directly but through a (currently)
	internal library. Hence, my fields of interest are the quality of the
	parsers (good and comprehensive results) and their code (speed, proof
	against any inputs, absence of memory leaks, regression tests), and a
	CTags library applications could use more readily. I am mostly a C
	developer, but as the maintainer of the CTags parsers in Geany I work
	on all parsers.

Masatake YAMATO <yamato@redhat.com>

	I'm using ctags in batch jobs running on my source code base
	where most of all source code in Fedora are deployed.  I'm an
	Emacs user, so generally I don't use ctags interactively
	except when hacking universal-ctags. Therefore my primary goal
	is to improve the robustness of parsers: I introduced Units
	test facility and badinput command for achieving the goal.
	The secondary goal is to support more languages and formats: I
	introduced optlib. I'm working on Fedora. I don't
	have access to the other platforms.

Qingming He <906459647@qq.com>

	I'm mainly a Fortran developer and I use ctags combined with Emacs to
	handle my projects. My goal is to improve the Fortran parser to make
	it support Fortran standards from 77 to 2008 and maybe 2015 to be
	released in the near future. I'm also interested in improving the lisp
	parsers (elisp and scheme).

Vitor Antunes <vitor.hda@gmail.com>

	I've been working with Verilog for most of the last 10
	years and am an avid Vim user. My goal is to improve the
	Verilog parser such that Vim can get the most out of it
	in plugins like Tagbar and to support the Omni
	completion plugin I am writing.

Cameron Eagans <me@cweagans.net>

        I've been a PHP developer for almost 10 years, and have been using Vim
        almost as long. My goal is to help guide the direction of the PHP
        parser, as well as maintain the ctags website and help guide new
        contributors to tasks that they may be able to help with. With time,
        I may end up contributing directly to ctags development, but my C skills
        are not so great at the moment.

Szymon Tomasz Stefanek <s.stefanek@gmail.com>

	I'm a multilanguage developer and I use ctags with my own text editor
	which has some IDE capabilities. I'm the maintainer of the new C/C++ parser.
