Currently (July 2016) the keywords "indexing", "is", and "creation" are all
deprecated in both the Eiffel Software and Liberty Eiffel dialects.

The "infix" and "prefix" keywords are deprecated by Eiffel Software. Liberty
Eiffel currently still supports them alongside "alias" though this is expected
to change in the near future.
