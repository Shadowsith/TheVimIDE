This one is prepared as part of a bug report,
sf-bugs:22, http://sourceforge.net/p/ctags/bugs/22/.

Darren Hiebert closed the bug with "closed-wont-fix"
status with following comment:

    The use of a macro call in an argument list, as shown in
    bad_code.c is too problematic to derive a good solution for.
    Such bizarre used of macros are rare and not worth the risk
    of breaking more common situations.

So I(Masatake YAMATO), don't touch this case and put it
here.
