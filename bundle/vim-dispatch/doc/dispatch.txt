INTRODUCTION                                    *dispatch*

Leverage the power of Vim's compiler system without being constrained by
synchronicity.

COMMANDS                                        *dispatch-commands*

                                                *dispatch-:Make*
:Make [arguments]       Using the current |:compiler| settings, dispatch a
                        build in the foreground.  Adapter strategies vary, but
                        the goal is visibility without stealing focus.  When
                        the build is complete, load the results into the
                        |quickfix| list and call |:cwindow|.  This command is
                        preferred for shorter tasks like "build this file."

:Make! [arguments]      Using the current compiler settings, dispatch a build
                        in the background.  Use |:Copen| to load the results.
                        This command is preferred for longer tasks like "run
                        the entire test suite."

                                                *dispatch-:Copen*
:Copen                  Load the latest build into the quickfix list and open
                        it with |:copen|.  You may call this before the
                        process is finished.

:Copen!                 Load the latest build into the quickfix list using a
                        catch-all parser.  This is useful when you can't tell
                        what went wrong.

                                                *dispatch-:Dispatch*
:Dispatch[!] [options] {program} [arguments]
                        Find a compiler plugin that sets 'makeprg' to
                        {program} and use its 'errorformat' to dispatch a
                        |:Make| for the given {program} and [arguments].  If
                        no compiler plugin is found, the generic format
                        %+I%.%# is used.

                        :Dispatch picks a compiler by looking for either
                        CompilerSet makeprg={program}\ [arguments] or
                        CompilerSet makeprg={program} in compiler plugins.
                        To force a given {program} to use a given {compiler},
                        create ~/.vim/after/compiler/{compiler}.vim and add to
                        it a line like the following: >

                        " CompilerSet makeprg={program}
<
                        If you need more control, *g:dispatch_compilers* can
                        be set to a dictionary with commands for keys and
                        compiler plugins for values.  Use an empty value to
                        skip the matched string and try again with the rest of
                        the command.
>
                        let g:dispatch_compilers = {
                              \ 'latex': 'tex',
                              \ 'bundle exec': ''}
<
                        You can optionally give one or more of the following
                        options before {program}:

                        -compiler=... force use of a compiler plugin
                        -dir=...      run command in given directory

                                                *b:dispatch*
:Dispatch[!]            Invoke |:Dispatch| with the options, program, and
                        arguments found in b:dispatch.  In the quickfix
                        window, this reruns the shown dispatch.  When no other
                        default is found, equivalent to |:Make|.

                                                *dispatch-:FocusDispatch*
:FocusDispatch [options] {program} [arguments]
                        Set a global default command for |:Dispatch| with no
                        arguments.  Overrides |b:dispatch|.

:FocusDispatch! [options] {program} [arguments]
                        Set a window local default command for |:Dispatch|
                        with no arguments.  Overrides |b:dispatch| and the
                        global default.

:FocusDispatch!         Clear the global and window local defaults for
                        |:Dispatch|.

:FocusDispatch          Show the task that would run when calling |:Dispatch|
                        with no arguments.

                                                *dispatch-:AbortDispatch*
:AbortDispatch          Abort the most recent build.

:AbortDispatch {command}
                        Abort the most recent build of {command}.

                                                *dispatch-:Start*
:Start [options] {command}
                        Start a process in a new, focused window.  If
                        {command} and the directory for execution match a
                        previous :Start invocation, focus it instead, if
                        possible.  Options:

                        -dir=...      run command in given directory
                        -title=...    short label for supported adapters
                        -wait=...     when to display press enter prompt:
                                      "always", "never", or "error"

:Start! [options] {command}
                        Start a process in a new, unfocused window.  If
                        {command} and the current working directory match
                        previous :Start invocation, do nothing.

                                                *b:start*
:Start[!]               With no arguments, |:Start| the options and command
                        given by |b:start|.  If not set, falls back to
                        'shell'.

                                                *dispatch-:Spawn*
:Spawn[!] [options] [command]
                        Like |:Start|, but always spawn a new process rather
                        than focusing an existing one.  The default is always
                        to spawn a new 'shell'.

MAPS                                            *dispatch-maps*

The following convenience maps are provided.

*m<CR>*                   |:Make|<CR>
*m<Space>*                |:Make|<Space>
*m!*                      |:Make|!
*m?*                      Show 'makeprg'
*`<CR>*                   |:Dispatch|<CR>
*`<Space>*                |:Dispatch|<Space>
*`!*                      |:Dispatch|!
*`?*                      |:FocusDispatch|<CR>
*'<CR>*                   |:Start|<CR>
*'<Space>*                |:Start|<Space>
*'!*                      |:Start|!
*'?*                      Show |b:start|
*g'<CR>*                  |:Spawn|<CR>
*g'<Space>*               |:Spawn|<Space>
*g'!*                     |:Spawn|!
*g'?*                     Show 'shell'

Use the g:nremap dictionary to override an individual map or set of maps with
a common prefix.  For example, the following changes all "m" maps to "q" maps:
>
    let g:nremap = {"m": "q"}
<
Use an empty string as the value to disable the map or maps entirely.

STRATEGIES                                      *dispatch-strategies*

Strategies are listed in order of precedence.  The first available one is
used.  Some strategies only provide for a subset of tasks.

Except for Tmux, which uses |VimResized|, all strategies require either |job|
support plus a file system with FIFOs (basically everything but Windows) or
|clientserver| support to do foreground makes.

Tmux ~

Foreground makes open in a small split at the bottom.  The closure of the
pane triggers a |VimResized| event which loads the results into the quickfix
list.

The tmux strategy can be used from the GUI as well.  Either start Vim from
inside of tmux or assign g:tmux_session.  This will use a new window for
foreground makes rather than a split.

Tmux 1.6 or newer is required.

GNU Screen ~

A new window is always used, since splits in GNU Screen are awkward.

Windows ~

You can use either the standard cmd.exe or a cygwin shell.  Both foreground
and background |:Make| invocations are started minimized to prevent focus
stealing.

iTerm ~

This strategy fires if you're in MacVim with at least one iTerm window open,
or if Vim is running in iTerm itself.

X11 ~

Uses g:dispatch_terminal_exec, "$TERMINAL -e", or "xterm -e".  Used only for
foreground |:Start| unless wmctrl is installed (which is used to switch the
focus back to Vim).

Headless ~

Forks tasks into the background.  It's working, you just can't see it.  Don't
forget to check |:Copen|.  The presence of this strategy means that |:Make!|
and |:Start!| will never block Vim.

Synchronous ~

When all else fails, a vanilla |:make| or |:!| is performed.
