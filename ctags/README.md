universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from
what existed in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags
repository was started by Reza Jelveh and was later moved to the
universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified working
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

## Difference ##

You may be interested in how universal-ctags is different from
exuberant-ctags. The critical and attractive changes are explained
in docs/\*.rst. The preformatted version is available on line,
http://docs.ctags.io/.

The most significant one is that Universal-ctags doesn't load
`~/.ctags` and `./.ctags` at starting up time. Instead, it loads
`~/.ctags.d/*.ctags` and `./.ctags.d/*.ctags`. See the above web
site and man pages
(man/ctags.1.rst.in and man/ctags-incompatibilities.7.in in the
source tree).
