If you are attempting to install Exuberant Ctags on a Unix-like platform
(one that can at least run a Bourne shell script) see the file INSTALL.

Installation Notes
==================

For non-Unix platforms, simple makefiles are provided:

    mk_mingw.mak  For Win32 using MinGW
    mk_mvc.mak    For Win32 using Microsoft Visual C++
