Test that the parser allows for the subset of extended ASCII characters in the
range 0xC0-0xFF. 

The specific range of characters allowed suggests the intent of this addition
was to catch accented Latin 1 identifier characters.  It's clearly less useful
in other encodings.

This is handled as a special case for Java and C# identifiers only.

See commits dce8772 and c9bd254.
