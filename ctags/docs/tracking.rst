* howto

  ::

      <svn>
      => <git: local universal-ctags repo>
	 => <git: local universal-ctags repo>


  1. prepare your own universal-ctags repo: a local git repo cloned from github.
     You may know how to do it :)

     ::

	$ git clone https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.git

  2. prepare exuberant-ctags SVN repo: a local git repo clone from exuberant-ctags svn tree.

    The original clone is already part of exuberant tree.

    To initialize your git repository with the required subversion information do ::

	$ git svn init https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ctags/code/trunk
	$ git update-ref refs/remotes/git-svn refs/remotes/origin/sourceforge

    and then ::

	$ git svn fetch
	$ git svn rebase

    to get the latest changes and reflect it to the local copy.

  3. merge

    TODO

  4. cherry-pick

     4.1. Make a branch at local universal-ctags repo and switch to it.

     4.2. Do cherry-pick like::

	 	$ git cherry-pick -s -x c81a8ce

     You can find commit id on the another terminal
     <git: local universal-ctags repo>::

	 	$ git log

     or ::

	 	$ git log --oneline

     If conflicts are occurred in cherry-picking, you can
     abort/reset cherry-picking with::

	 $ git reset --hard

     <git: local universal-ctags repo>
      at the branch for picking.

Other interesting ctags repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several interesting repo's with ctags around. These are
interesting to integrate in the future.

`VIM-Japan <https://github.com/vim-jp/ctags/>`_
......................................................................

VIM-Japan have some interesting things, especially regarding encoding.

`Anjuta <https://git.gnome.org/browse/anjuta/tree/plugins/symbol-db/anjuta-tags>`_
.......................................................................................

Anjuta is a Gnome IDE. They did not fork Exuberant ctags, but they did
natively include it in Anjuta. They have made several additions to
their version of it including fairly extensive Vala language support.
